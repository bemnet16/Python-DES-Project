# DES Algorithm Implementation in Python

## Overview

This **DES Algorithm Implementation** is a Python-based cryptographic tool, designed to offer robust encryption and decryption functionalities using the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**. This project is essential for those interested in cryptography and the implementation of one of the most widely used symmetric-key algorithms.

## Features

- **Encryption & Decryption**: Implements DES for both encrypting and decrypting data, ensuring secure communication.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Includes a graphical user interface for easy interaction with the tool.
- **Key Generation**: Generates secure keys using DES specifications.
- **Detailed Constants and Permutations:** All necessary constants and permutations for DES are included and clearly structured.
